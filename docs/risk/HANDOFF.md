# Risk & Clearing handoff (book, oracle and frontend teams)

Branch `integration/risk` · spec v1.1 · economic baseline v1.0 · local-fixture level only.
**No deployment exists or is authorized.** Every result below uses mock counterparts; the live
join with each of your systems is BLOCKED until your code runs these fixtures
(`artifacts/risk/counterpart-status.json`).

## 1. What the engine is

One isolated engine per market. It is composed of Person B's risk, lifecycle and settlement
controllers and Person A's accounting, custody and settlement ledgers, joined by
`contracts/src/engine/RiskAccountingBridge.sol`. Collateral is held by `CollateralVault` (A017).
The test composition `contracts/test/integration/CombinedEngine.sol` adds a mock order book
(`MockBookAdapter`). Size: 108,270 B runtime with the mock book, which is above EIP-170; no chain
limit or contract split has been chosen yet.

## 2. ABIs

- Engine: `artifacts/risk/engine-abi.json` (246 entries; mock-book and test-only entries removed).
- Vault: `artifacts/risk/vault-abi.json`.
- Book seam (internal, not an ABI): `contracts/src/interfaces/IBookRiskHooks.sol`.
- Oracle seam: `contracts/src/interfaces/IResolutionIngress.sol` (`IResolutionEngine`).
- Price observations: `contracts/src/interfaces/IPriceSource.sol` (`submitObservation(obs, sig)`).
- Market config: `contracts/src/interfaces/IMarketConfig.sol` (`Listing`, `validateListing`).

Mutating entry points:

| Who | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User (via vault) | `CollateralVault.deposit(atoms)`, `allocate(engine, atoms, false)`, `withdraw(atoms)` | exact-receipt deposits only (fee-on-transfer rejected). The first allocation registers the trader; engine trader id = registry index + 1 (`traderIdAt(i)`, `traderIdOf(addr)`) |
| User | `release(atoms)` | guarded by B's release decision and A's coverage; `previewRelease` / `previewAccount.usableReleaseAtoms` gives the exact usable amount at this block |
| LP / capital authority | `CollateralVault.allocate(engine, atoms, true)` | shares 1:1 only before activation; afterwards a donation (no shares) |
| LP | `ReserveVault.notice()` then `redeemReserve(owner)` | 7-day notice; only after claims are prepared |
| Governance | `activateMarket()`, `stageRiskParams(params)` | activation opens the first accounting epoch |
| Monitor | `requestReduceOnly(reason)`, `clearReduceOnly(reason)`, `raiseHazards(h0, h1)` | cannot halt, finalize or lower hazards |
| Anyone (keepers) | `beginRollover()`, `rollPage(n<=32)`, `finishRollover()` | hourly accounting epochs; trading pauses from epoch end until the last page |
| Anyone | `floorSweep(n<=32)` | backing floor at T-12h |
| Anyone | `liquidate(trader, maxLots, maxExaminations<=64, partner)` | book close, pair reduction (partner != 0) or takeover; zero-effect calls pay nothing |
| Anyone | `materializeScheduledHalt()` at or after T | |
| Pinned oracle | `halt()`, `settle(Y)`, `settleInvalid()` | see section 6 |
| Anyone | `captureInvalidPrice()`, `prepareSnapshotChunk(n)`, `preparePayoutChunk(n)`, `finishPreparation()` | bounded jobs (n <= 32) |
| Anyone (pays the owner) | `claimTrader(owner)`, then `CollateralVault.claim(engine, owner)` | once only |
| Keeper / treasury | `withdrawKeeper()`, `withdrawTreasury()` | whole atoms; the fractional Q stays a liability |
| Price adapter | `submitObservation(obs, sig)` | authenticated; see `IPriceSource` |
| Disabled | `selectConversionMode()` | reverts: conversion is disabled (DEC-10) |

## 3. Units

| Field | Unit |
|---|---|
| `*Q` (cash, fees, premium, budgets) | Q = one USDC atom × 1e18 (`cashQ` int256, \|cashQ\| < 2^180) |
| atoms (custody, payouts, claims) | 1e-6 USDC |
| lots / `positionLots` | 1 lot = 0.001 claim; \|position\| ≤ 2^40 |
| tick | 1..999, price = tick / 1000 |
| `*Wad` (prices, probabilities) | 1e18 = 1.0 |
| payoff | `PAYOFF_Q_PER_LOT = 1000 Q`; E0 = cash, E1 = cash + 1000 Q × lots, mark equity = cash + 1000 × lots × markWad (no second WAD division) |
| fill cash | `lots × tick × Q` on both legs |
| funding | `rateQPerLotSec` (Q per lot per second), index `fundingFQ` (Q per lot) |
| time | uint64 Unix seconds |

## 4. Events

Accounting (A): `CashAllocated`, `AccountRegistered`, `AccountSynced(owner, fundingPaymentQ, premiumQ, cutoff)`,
`PairedPosting(buyer, seller, lots, tick, feesQ)`, `FundingAdvanced`, `EpochOpened`, `SweepProgress`,
`AccountTakenOver`, `EconomicHalt`, `ClaimsPrepared`, `AccountBalance(owner, lots, cashQ, fundingCheckpointQ)`,
`MarketBalance(allocationQ, reserveLots, reserveCashQ, protocolFeeQ, keeperPayableQ, fundingClearingQ, cushionQ, budgetQ, oiAllLots)`.
The last `AccountBalance` per trader and the last `MarketBalance` reconstruct the ledger (tested in
`contracts/test/integration/EndToEnd.t.sol`, step 10).

Risk / lifecycle / settlement (B): `ReservationChanged`, `MakerPruned`, `OrdersInvalidated`,
`MarketOrdersInvalidated`, `FloorOrdersInvalidated`, `GraceStarted`, `GraceCleared`,
`LiquidationOutcome`, `PairReduction`, `PairSkipped`, `BookCloseAttempt`, `FloorSweepProgress`,
`PricingModeChanged`, `RiskProfileActivated`, `ObservationAccepted`, `PerpObservationRecorded`,
`FreshnessGap`, `MovementRestriction`, `MonitorRestriction`, `HazardRaiseRequested`, `MarketHalted`,
`OracleFinalityAccepted`, `InvalidPriceCaptured`, `SnapshotPreparationProgress`,
`PayoutPreparationProgress`, `ClaimsEnabled`, `RecoveryRequired`, `ClaimModeSelected`.
Vault: `Deposit`, `Allocation`, `Released`, `Escrowed`, `Paid`.

## 5. Reason codes and errors

Order and admission outcomes are returned, not reverted (`RejectCode` in `src/math/RiskTypes.sol`):
`NONE, HALTED, BAD_STAGE, OUTSIDE_BAND, BELOW_MIN_SIZE, NO_REDUCIBLE_POSITION, MAKER_BELOW_IM,
MAKER_BELOW_MM, TAKER_CAPACITY, ACCOUNT_DEFICIT_CAP, MARKET_COVERAGE, INVALID_PRICE_OR_SIZE, STALE_ORDER`.
Book steps return `StepStatus {FILLED, PRUNE_MAKER, STOP_TAKER}`. Liquidation returns
`LiquidationMath.Result` (DONE, NEEDS_MORE_WORK, TAKEOVER_AUTHORIZED, …) and `Mode` (NONE, REDUCE, TAKEOVER).
Reverts are kept for authorization, arithmetic and invariant failures: `RiskUnauthorized`,
`Unauthorized`, `Rejected` (A refused an action B did not authorize), `Coverage` (INV-04),
`BadState`, `Stale`, `BadUnits`, `Bounds`, `UnexpectedCoverageFailure`, `OutcomeOrPricePending`,
`PreparationIncomplete`, `ConflictingFinalOutcome`, `ConversionDisabled`; the full list is in the ABI.

## 6. View schemas

- `previewAccount(trader)` → identity (block, time, risk version, mark availability), `cashQ`,
  `positionLots`, `projectedFundingQ`, `projectedPremiumQ` (estimates, not withdrawable),
  `e0Q`, `e1Q`, `markEquityQ`, `mmQ`, `imQ`, `fullBackingRequired`, `status`, `orders`, `usableReleaseAtoms`.
- `previewOrder(trader, side, limitTick, lots, reduceOnly)` → `rejection`, `acceptedCapLots`, `feeCapQ`,
  `mode`, `fullBackingRequired`, `eMinQ`, `requiredImQ`, `d0AfterQ`, `d1AfterQ`, `marketCoverageAfter`, `halvingSteps`.
- `accountRiskView(trader)`, `marketRiskView()`: stage, pricing mode, accounting state, index/mark
  (availability flags; an unavailable mark is never 0), pending work bits, floor progress.
- `getSettlementStatus()` → `SettlementView` {phase, halted, finalOutcome, oracleFinalityAccepted,
  invalidPriceReady, settlementPriceE18, snapshotId, cursors, accountCount, totals, claimsEnabled,
  accountingComplete, recoveryRequired}. Show `ORACLE_FINAL_PRICE_PENDING`, `ORACLE_FINAL_PREPARING`
  and `CLAIMABLE` distinctly. Only `claimsEnabled` makes a payout button live.
- `getHaltSnapshot()` → `HaltView` {halted, economicHaltAt, haltRecordedAt, accrualCutoff, oiHaltLots, …}.
- Ledger views: `account(owner)`, `reserve()`, `coverageSlacks()`, `allocationQ()`, `traderAtoms(owner)`,
  `claimableAtoms(owner)`.
- SDK: `packages/risk-sdk` (`decodeAccount`, `decodeMarket`, `decodeSettlementStatus`, `isClaimable`,
  `AccountingReplay`). SDK values are never authoritative; fixtures in `docs/app-state-fixtures.json`.

Known gaps: `ClearingPhase.COMPLETE` is never reported (A037 has no "all claimed" counter, R-10);
conversion eligibility is always `DISABLED`.

## 7. Book team

The seam the engine needs is `IBookRiskHooks` (nine `_risk*` hooks). `Book.sol` currently exposes a
different hook set; the ten exact mismatches are listed in `docs/requests/B-to-book-hooks.md`.
To run our fixtures against your book:

1. Compose your book with the engine in place of `MockBookAdapter` in
   `contracts/test/integration/CombinedEngine.sol` (same constructor), calling the `_risk*` hooks in
   the order shown by `MockBookAdapter._mockPlaceWithMode` / `_mockRest` / `_mockCancel`.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   cd contracts && forge test --match-path "test/gates/G4.t.sol"
   cd contracts && forge test --match-path "test/gates/G5.t.sol"
   cd contracts && forge test --match-path "test/integration/EndToEnd.t.sol"
   ```
3. Also replay the B seam vectors: `forge test --match-path test/risk/B/BookSeam.t.sol` (scripted
   accounting) and report PASS or the exact failing assertion.

## 8. Oracle team

The engine accepts only the pinned `resolutionAuthority` from the listing. Oracle source enum
{NONE=0, YES=1, NO=2, INVALID=3} is mapped explicitly (`OracleOutcomeMap.engineCallFor`):
YES → `settle(1)`, NO → `settle(0)`, INVALID → `settleInvalid()`, NONE reverts; a VOIDED value
(4, guessed; B assumption I-5, unconfirmed) is treated as INVALID.
`halt()` is constant work (285,157 gas measured locally); finality acceptance is constant work
(49,718 gas, identical with 2 and 34 accounts). A repeated identical finality is a no-op; a
conflicting one reverts. INVALID waits for the scheduled [T-24h, T] index window, or the disclosed
0.5 fallback one hour after T if data is missing. To run our fixtures against your oracle:
replace `MockResolutionAuthority` (`contracts/test/mocks/B/MockResolutionAuthority.sol`) with your
contract bound to the engine, then run
`cd contracts && forge test --match-path "test/gates/G6.t.sol"` and
`forge test --match-path test/risk/B/OracleCompatibility.t.sol`. Fixture data:
`docs/counterpart-oracle-fixtures.json`.

## 9. Frontend / indexer

Read views at one block and label every value with that block (`PreviewIdentity`). Reconstruct
balances from `AccountBalance` / `MarketBalance` events or the views; never keep an alternative
ledger. Projections (funding, premium) are estimates and are not withdrawable; only
`usableReleaseAtoms` is. Run the SDK fixtures:
`bash scripts/check-task.sh B042` (needs `tsc` on PATH).

## 10. Status and limits

- Gates G0–G6: technical checks pass on real A+B (`docs/spec/gate_status.json`); Person A has not
  reviewed. G7 is open (A043 is Person A's review of B).
- Invariant campaign INV-01..INV-10: `artifacts/risk/invariant-campaign.json`.
- Gas (Ethereum/Prague schedule in forge, not Monad): `artifacts/risk/gas-engine.json`.
- Release defaults and missing production inputs: `artifacts/risk/release-manifest.json`.
- Open audit findings: A-F01 (Medium), A-F02 and A-F03 (Low) in `docs/merge/A-audit.md`.
